Babe Ruth was a professional baseball player in the MLB from 1914-1935. Ruth is also known as the greatest baseball player of all time. Babe Ruth was been an incredible player in his time, although where would he stand if he was playing in the today's league, is the question that I am asking. There are a lot of things that we must take into a look at before seeing where he stands. By looking at the statistics in the MLB in today's world and Babe Ruth's era, the numbers should align that he would not be as significant of a player.

Babe Ruth and Mike Trout are easily top MLB players to date. By looking at each season and hits per game both players had, were able to see how Babe Ruth was a significantly better batter in his time. You compare the years of 1927 and 2024, there are many people that stick out who have broke records but Mike Trout caught my eye.
